# Vigenere-Cipher
CIS-7 Project
Project Description: Our project is on the Vigenere Cipher. We created a program to encrypt plaintext entered by the user by using a key. The program can also decrypt messages that have already been encrypted. This is all done with the use of a reciprocal table of letters.
